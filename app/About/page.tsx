            My name is James, and I&apos;m a front end web developer. Growing up, I edited websites like mySpace and deadJournal so I could have a unique look and feel to my page.
            After high school, I got a Bachelor&apos;s degree, and even joined the Air Force, but I still hadn&apos;t found my passion. I went on to work for Keller Williams Realty International 
            assisting agents customize their real estate websites. I loved it! Since then, I&apos;ve honed my talents and want to share my passion for developing websites by developing yours!
